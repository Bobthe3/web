# Test Blog with Mathematical Equations

Testing 

## Mathematical Concepts

Here's a simple equation that demonstrates the relationship between energy and mass:

$$E = mc^2$$

And here's a more complex integral that appears frequently in probability theory:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$


### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is one of the most fundamental equations in algebra:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Advanced Mathematics

### Matrix Operations

Here's a matrix multiplication example:

$$\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} ax + by \\ cx + dy \end{bmatrix}$$

### Calculus

The fundamental theorem of calculus states:

$$\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)$$


### Series and Summations

The Taylor series expansion of $e^x$ is:

$$e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots$$
