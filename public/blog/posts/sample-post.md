# Test Blog with Mathematical Equations

Testing the markdown parser with mathematical equations.

## Mathematical Concepts

Here's a simple equation that demonstrates the relationship between energy and mass:

$$E = mc^2$$

And here's a more complex integral that appears frequently in probability theory:

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$


### Quadratic Formula

The quadratic formula is one of the most fundamental equations in algebra:

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$$

## Advanced Mathematics

### Matrix Operations

Here's a matrix multiplication example:

$$\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\ y \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} ax + by \\ cx + dy \end{bmatrix}$$

### Calculus

The fundamental theorem of calculus states:

$$\frac{d}{dx} \int_a^x f(t) dt = f(x)$$

### Limits

The definition of a limit is:

$$\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$$

### Derivatives

The definition of a derivative is:

$$\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$$

### Integration by Parts

Integration by parts is a powerful technique for integrating products of functions:

$$\int u dv = uv - \int v du$$

### Series and Summations

The Taylor series expansion of $e^x$ is:

$$e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + x + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots$$



## Conclusion

This was a test of the markdown parser.
