# AI Slop

[TOC]

Init. Idea Goal: Copy Azerbaijan Technologies but with another Ethnicity - [LINK](https://www.instagram.com/lucamaxiim/?hl=en)

Goal: Make AI slop that can pay for my trip to Costa Rica

# Components

1. The Actual imagery of the video itself

   1. Look into Veo 3 using Flow to see how to make the story boards

      1. I think Veo 3 Ingredients to Video is the best bet - Needs google AI ultra - 120 for 3 months

         > This is a fuck ton of prompting ngl. Is worth to get a dedicated project just to aid on this

   2. There are 2 features that they have for this one is text to video but also frames to video. I think it is worth while to spend time using Sora 4 images to make the images and a unique brand identity. 

   - The script
     - Grok AI - [LINK](https://grok.com/share/c2hhcmQtMg%3D%3D_313ecf71-82b1-4713-a0c1-c7247379081a) this is good but it needs heavy prompting guidelines
       - This would be done in creating guidelines and research docs that are including always in the context window

2. The Audio 

   1. Script narration 
      1. ElevenLabs
   2. The subtitles 
      1. I think there is a good AI for subtitles and this is a secondary step. Maybe videos with and without subtitles and see how they differ 
      1. Capcut or jus

3. Background music

   1. Use whatever the promoted background music is whatever could convict higher pay per scroll

The script and the imagery are connected. How do we decide upon a premise of the video. 

- Idea 1: The ideas are kind of collective mind  / topic of the day type shit - I think Twitter is honestly the best place to go for this content and hit the most reacted to topics of the week and give a detailed summary of the events that happened and create the script from there
  - I think there are enough topics to stick with this

-------

# Misc. Ideas

> Just make it in another language lol - English is always the crest of the wave - let it trickle into other countries now

> Would be interesting to see the level of sophistication of each platform across demographics

> Captions or no captions 
>
> â€‹	- Exact captions or descriptive captions

# Brand Identity 

Azerbaijan tech. Has the fat fucking Turkish dude which is noticeable for them and they viewers can create an association between the accounts. 

Using Sora or Veo or image generation methodology. Create a personal brand identity for some kind of brand ambassador. 

Let's be specific and target a specific ethnic group. I think obscure

# Choice of Services

## Communication and Database

Google drive and Telegram 

## Topic Identification

1. Grok
1. Perplexity

Both options are pretty good and it would be interesting to see their differences - only 2 frontier providers that have real time axis

## Script Generation

1. Grok
2. Claude has good creative writing skills tho 

I feel writing this prompt is the most impactful - akin to writing a short story

## Video Creation

1. Runway AI - holy shit -
2. Veo 3 Story Board
3. Saba - reached out to the ben who is the dude - based in SF - based on Veo 3 

## Key Image Creation

1. Google Whisk with style references 

## Narration Service

1. 11 Labs 

## Subtitles

1. Capcut

2. Another service 

   Lets hold back on subtitles for now till we can solidify the other items

## Distribution

Start by manually doing it before but theres a service where it auto posts to all platforms

# Steps for me:

1. Identify a Niche / Brand Identity 
   - Possible choices include:
     - Football memes / news
     - Political events 
     - Current events - Trending on X type of things
     - Music Industry Slop 
     - Sports Betting
       - Idk how this will work but could be lucrative if partnering with Whop mfs who want to promote their bets
     - Video Games
       - Lower barrier for high quality video content due to video games looking retarded. But Market at a much higher concentration 
     - The harambe or straight side camera angle of someone yapping
   - Create brand identity package 
     - If making it first person based with common characters create good generations of the characters for style reference guides. 
     - Also reference guide of what the lighting, color scale, brightness, and the visual appearance identify will confide by 
2. Identify where the script will be coming from
   - Grok does this the best as it appears to be the only mainstream LLM that has the ability to get dam near real time context and act upon it
   - Establish strong guidelines on how the script should flow, act, and behave 
     - This is crucial to keep a constant brand and to hit goals. Variation here will be applied
3. Establish Video guidelines 
   1. Visual identity 

Brand identity and story + creating an ai assistant to track progress

Whisk has the ability to keep a constant subject and style which is useful 

- Can also provide context to the reference images to ensure that it abides by the script

# Automated process:

1. Use Grok to get top n recent trending items in field of niche - **Research**
   1. Gain core information about the item and how it could be conveyed to someone else
   2. There should be some conditions here to ensure that the event has gained enough traction to be impactful and not a waste. 
      1. We do not want to be hitting everything just the ones that are the most impactful
      2. Because of the cost we need to be prioritising quality of content over mass - no capital. 
   3. I think this is better to be done by hand the live searching pricing is medium bad 50 live searches for 1.25. Where as it is free an easier to do while just using the normal chat.
2. Script Formatting -

   The AI should be able to make a script document that has the entire script broken down to the T of what it should say. 

   1. Apply this into the script writing format to be on edge and impactful
   2. AI could be used for this to make it into a structured output. This could be done in the **Research** stage
   3. Create key images of the script
      1. Use style guide and reference photos
      2. These should be sent to a review process first to ensure they are good 

3. Create short form video using images and script
   1. There should be 2 scripts, audio and visual 
      1. Possibility for more scripts to be created - camera flow, visual and sound effects
4. Compile the short form video with no audio
5. Use audio service to generate the audio file for the video
6. Subtitlies - TBD later
7. Compile all 
   1. Need to look into a process for this 
8. Sent to review box 
9. Distribution
10. Again
